			These are the network companies that broadcast the
			series. Their scope is very limited (statistical - 
			and even that, not yet implemented).<br><br>
			In the application, the networks are indexed in a list
			in the database, in order to avoid repetitions.
			Networks are referenced by series; a new one is 
			added only when it is needed, and deleted when
			no longer referenced.<br><br>
