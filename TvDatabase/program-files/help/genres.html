			These are the stylistic categories that TV series 
			fall into, and are useful in helping viewers
			discover new, similar series that they might enjoy.
			If you like <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i>, you're 
			likely to also want to watch <i>NCIS</i>, which are 
			both categorized as <i>crime</i> and <i>drama</i>.<br><br>
			In the application, the genres are indexed in a list
			in the database, in order to avoid repetitions.
			Genres are referenced by series (more than one genre
			per series is normal); a new one is  added only when 
			it is needed, and deleted when no longer referenced.<br><br>
		</span>
		<span class="note">
			Unlike other data types, which are downloaded from 
			<a href="http://thetvdb.com">thetvdb.com</a> in separate
			data structures, genres are decoded from a vertical-line
			separated text, and may therefore present issues if they
			are not properly formatted on the website.<br><br>
