		<span class="subtitle">Overview</span><br>
		<span class="content">
			These are the languages spoken throughout the series
			by the actors (and possibly through means of non-verbal
			communication). They exist in order to inform potential
			viewers of whether they would understand the dialogues
			without subtitles.<br><br>
			In the application, the languages are indexed in a list
			in the database, in order to avoid repetitions, but 
			otherwise have limited practical use.<br><br>
		</span>
		<span class="note">
			Unlike other data types, which are added to the database
			only when necessary, languages are downloaded at the
			beginning of the update in bulk, and kept during all times.
			This however, because of their small number, does not 
			affect performance in any way.<br><br>
